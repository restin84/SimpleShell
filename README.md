SimpleShell
===========

SimpleShell.c displays the code for a simple Unix like command interpreter. Once the program is compiled and running, user input is tokenized into commands and arguments, a new process is created, and a system call is made with the parsed input. The shell supports basic commands such as ls or pwd. There is also a history feature which tracks the last 10 commands entered.
